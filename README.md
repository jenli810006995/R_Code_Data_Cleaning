# R_Code_Data_Cleaning
This is the code in R I used to clean the historical data in biochemical industry, around 80,000 observations, presented ANSI/ASQ Z1.9 variable sampling formula (as the folow chart attached).

I created this program to calculate mean, standard deviation, F value, MSD, QL,QU,PL,PU,P value and M value. 
By comparing M value and P value, we can decide if the lot would be accepted or not. And then compute the probability of acceptance for each quality characteristics.

In addition, the variable sampling plan requests randomization, this also applied to the data in this program.
